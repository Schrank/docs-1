# Security

Security is always important!\
Please keep in mind, that dockware is primary made for local development!\
\
This does not mean you cannot use it for a server that is available on the internet.\
But please consider a few security related things.

**Don't expose ports like you would do locally**

In our docker-compose.yaml samples, you see all kinds of ports being exposed.\
This is great for local development - but not for a server - even it's "just" a staging system.\
\
Our recommendation is to only expose ports that are really necessary to use your app.\
And this should only be done through 1 single docker container, probably a proxy like NGINX.\
This helps you to avoid losing control over what is exposed throughout your (bigger) yaml file.\
\
If you expose a port, make sure to add an additional restriction if possible.\
\
This sample would only expose the port 3306 MySQL for connections from the localhost (host system).\
So you can do a default SSH connection to your host, and then a connection from there to your MySQL container. This is pretty much the basic workflow of such a scenario - only with Docker ;).

{% code title="docker-compose.yaml (partial)" %}
```
127.0.0.1:3306:3306
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Attention**

Please do never expose port 22 from dockware on an online server if you do not know what you are doing! Pay attention to the weak default credentials - and consider using a firewall.
