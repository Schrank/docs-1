# Code Styles

Please ensure that your source code uses the Shopware guidelines regarding code styles.\
\
Use the following tools and commands to scan your source code.\
Please note some features provide the option to "auto-fix" problems. Keep in mind that you need to download affected files to your host in that case. Maybe just download everything, GIT will show you all diffs anyway.\


**CS Fixer**

{% code title="IN DOCKER" %}
```
./psh.phar fix-cs
```
{% endcode %}

**ESLint**\
****Run this command do analyze and auto-fix your modifications in the administration.IN DOCKER

{% code title="IN DOCKER" %}
```
cd platform/src/Administration/Resources/app/administration && ./node_modules/.bin/eslint --fix --ext .js,.vue src test
```
{% endcode %}

**PHPStan and Psalm**\
****Last but not least, run the static analyzer to check your code quality with help of PHPStan and Psalm.

{% code title="IN DOCKER" %}
```
./psh.phar static-analyze
```
{% endcode %}

Here is a final copy-paste script that you can use to run all these tools and also automatically download the source code again.

{% code title="ON HOST" %}
```
docker exec -it shopware bash -c './psh.phar fix-cs'
docker exec -it shopware bash -c 'cd platform/src/Administration/Resources/app/administration && ./node_modules/.bin/eslint --fix --ext .js,.vue src test'
docker exec -it shopware bash -c './psh.phar static-analyze'
docker cp shopware:/var/www/html/platform/src/. ./src/platform/src
```
{% endcode %}
