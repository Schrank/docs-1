# Pimp my Log

Logs are very important.\
And we know about the frustration when not being able to access it easily.\
And that's why every dockware images comes with an installed [Pimp my Log](https://www.pimpmylog.com) log viewer.

Open the log viewer in your web browser with the following URL:\
_/logs_

Switch between different prepared logs, such as Apache error logs, access logs as well as Shopware logs for either production or development.
