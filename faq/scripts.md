# Scripts (PSH?)

**Where are my scripts?**

If you are looking for official scripts to e.g. build the storefront or administration, you might want to look into the **bin** folder of Shopware.\
\
the #play and #dev images of dockware are both based on the production template.\
\
If you want to dig deeper, please see this page for further details: [shopware/production](https://github.com/shopware/production) on GitHub.\
\
If you use dockware #contribute, you can use the official **PSH** commands of Shopware.
