# Shopware 5 Support

**Do we support Shopware 5?**

The main focus of dockware is definitely Shopware 6.\
Still we heard your requests about supporting Shopware 5.\
\
So we have decided to do a limited support of Shopware 5 with a few versions (and not every single one).\
\
It works basically the same as with Shopware 6. Only a few things like watchers and so on are either different or not included.\
\
Please see [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/dockware) for existing Shopware 5 versions.
